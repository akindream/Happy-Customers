# 🚀 Customer Satisfaction Prediction for a Logistics Startup  

## 📌 Project Overview  
A fast-growing logistics and delivery startup is working to enhance **customer satisfaction** and **optimize operations** before expanding globally. However, predicting customer dissatisfaction remains challenging due to limited direct feedback.  

To address this, a **survey** was conducted among select customers to gather insights on their experiences. This **machine learning project** aims to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model to identify key factors contributing to **customer dissatisfaction (Class 0)**.  

---

## 🔍 **Dataset Information**  

The dataset consists of **customer feedback attributes (X)** and a **target variable (Y)** indicating satisfaction:  
- **Y (Target Variable)**  
  - **0** → Unhappy Customer  
  - **1** → Happy Customer  

- **Feature Descriptions:**  
  - **X1:** My order was delivered on time  
  - **X2:** Contents of my order were as I expected  
  - **X3:** I ordered everything I wanted to order  
  - **X4:** I paid a good price for my order  
  - **X5:** I am satisfied with my courier  
  - **X6:** The app makes ordering easy for me  

---

## 🛠 **Data Processing & Strategy**  

### **📌 Target Variable**  
- Binary classification: **0 = Unhappy, 1 = Happy**  
- **Class Distribution**: No major imbalance (**69 happy vs. 57 unhappy customers**).  

### **📌 Preprocessing**  
- Cleaned and standardized the dataset.  
- Performed feature scaling where necessary.  

### **📌 Dimensionality Reduction via PCA**  
The **principal components** explain variance as follows:  
- **PC1: 37%**, **PC2: 19%**, **PC3: 15%**, **PC4: 12%**, **PC5: 10%**, **PC6: 8%**  

### **📌 Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) Insights**  
Feature ranking (most to least significant) using `SGDClassifier`:  
- **X1, X4, X2, X5, X3, X6**  

#### **Model Testing with Feature Removal (Using NearestCentroid)**  
| Features Removed | Recall (0) |
|-----------------|------------|
| All features included | **58.3%** |
| Removed weakest feature (**X6**) | **75%** |
| Further removals (RFE ranking) | **50%, 50%, 66.7%, 66.7%** |

💡 **Key Insight:** The weakest feature, **X6 (Ease of App Usage)**, can be **removed** to improve the model's focus on dissatisfied customers.

## 🤖 **Modeling Approach**  

### **🎯 Focus**  
- Prioritizing **recall (0)** to minimize false negatives in predicting **unhappy customers**.  

### **📊 Evaluation Metrics**  
✔ **Recall (0) → Primary Metric** (Minimizing false negatives for unhappy customers)  
✔ **Additional Metrics → Precision, F1-score, Accuracy**  

### **🧪 Models Tested**  
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost  
- **Ensemble Models**: **VotingClassifier** & **StackingClassifier**  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: `Hyperopt` used for best performance  

### **🏆 Best Model Selected: `NearestCentroid`**

## 🚀 **Expected Impact**  

✅ **Proactively identify unhappy customers** and address their concerns  
✅ **Optimize delivery operations** based on data-driven insights  
✅ **Improve overall customer experience** → Increased retention & brand loyalty  
✅ **Streamline customer surveys** → Focus only on the most important questions
